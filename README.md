# Development

## 1. Backend 
### Configuration

In our project, we use a configuration file that loads environment variables. This allows us to interact with them. The configuration file is located at:

```bash
src/backend/core/configs.py
```

### Initializing Environment Variables
We can initialize environment variables using the `EXPORT` command or by creating a .env file based on the .env.template.

##### Example of initializing an environment variable:

```bash
export POSTGRES_HOST=jp2
```

#####  The .env File
To create a .env file, copy the .env.template and fill in the values:
```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=
POSTGRES_PORT=
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=
```

### Start application
There are two methods to start our application:

#### 1. Using Uvicorn:
    
To start the application with Uvicorn, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 --reload
```
#### 2. Using Docker-compose

Ensure you are in the root directory (e.g., trip-planner). Docker Compose can be used for rebuilding and launching the application. Execute the command below:
```bash 
docker-compose up -d --build
```


## 2. Frontend 

To run the frontend in a developer environment, you should install the following:

**For web:**
- Node.js (Specify the version according to your OS)
- React Native: `npm install react-native`
- Expo: `npm install expo`

**For Android:**
All the requirements mentioned for the web, and additionally:
- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- Create an Android emulator

**For iOS:**
- Xcode: This is the IDE for iOS development. Install the latest version from the Mac App Store. Ensure your Mac is updated to a compatible OS version as required by Xcode.

To start, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
Then, choose the desired option from the Expo menu.
